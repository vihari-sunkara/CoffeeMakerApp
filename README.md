# CoffeeMakerApp
Object Oriented Design of a Coffee Machine
## Driver class
This has the main method to instantiate coffee machine object and run the methods to test the functionality. The code in this class is mostly commented. Please uncomment specific parts of it  to test the relevant features.

## Entities
The following are the list of important entities which could be obvious.
- CoffeeMachine
- Inventory
- Beverage
- Recipe

## Other files
Other class files include constants file which are mostly redundant for now, but can be useful as and when new Beverages get added to our machine. 

## Scope for improvisation
As of now, recipe maker has a hard coded recipe for each of the beverages. It does not regard the Open-Closed principle of SOLID principles. The code design will be improved as and when I learn from my mistakes :) 

## Comments in the code
Please refer to the comments in the code for a better clarity since they are very diligently written to make the user understand the intention behind the logic.
